# HARTING Coding Challenge

Welcome to our coding challenge. This is your chance to demonstrate your capabilities to us, so feel free to impress us. We are really looking forward to your results and wish you much success.

## Task

Create a single page application that uses the [Game of Thrones API](https://anapioficeandfire.com/) to show all the Game of Thrones houses in an overview. By clicking on one house a detail page with more information of that house should be displayed.

The design and UX is completely up to you. We do not expect a fully designed application, so please focus on a fully functional solution. However the application should be usable and contain some basic styling.

## Requirements

- overview page that displays all houses
- each house has its own detail page
- all Game of Thrones related data is retrieved from the [API](https://anapioficeandfire.com/)
- provide your results using [GitHub](https://github.com/vsartison/HARTING-Angular-Coding-Challenge)
  - create a fork of this git
  - should contain:
    - a readme that explains us how to run your application (you can replace this readme)
    - your angular code
    - a compiled version of your application
  - appreciated by us:
    - a commit history with more than one commit that contains all

## What's important to us

- clean code and file structure
- human readable documentation but keep it short
- prevent unnecessarily complex solutions
